    "This was a project about Tobis Twitter Network. The question we asked ourself was: \"Which people (accounts) are influencing Tobis Feed the most?\". To answer the question we used methods from the Social Network Analysis. Our first approach was to collect all friends (people which Tobi is following) and check which of his friends has overlapping friends. The second approach was to just create a network with all friends and friends of friends (2nd grade friends) from Tobi and calculate the centrallity betweenness of each node."
